# ASL - American Sign Language
Neural_Networks_Digital_Image_Processing

## General
 - I have pictures of sign language, and after creating simple neural network model for classification we have accuracy about 70%

Look of pictures at the beggining, these images are RGB

- From now on Im working with images loaded with single channel - in order to apply digital image preprocessing

- Next I experimented with different combinations of filters and try them to see if there is any improvement, and slowly there was a progress

- After some time I couldnt raise accuracy any more, with 2 median and one addaptive gaussian filters I found accuracy of 82%
